## ðŸ”„ GitHub Actions & Merge Conflicts
This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Workflows are triggered on both **pushes** and **pull requests**.

- When you create or update a Pull Request, GitHub Actions runs the workflow on the PR branch.  
- If the PR has **merge conflicts**, the workflow still runs on the PR branch, but **no run is triggered on `main`** until the conflicts are resolved.  
- GitHub will show a warning:  
  > "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved before merging."  

### âœ… Best Practices
- Always pull the latest changes from `main` before opening a PR.  
- Resolve conflicts locally, then push the updated branch.  
- Once conflicts are fixed, the Actions workflow will re-run and merging can proceed.
